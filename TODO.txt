Use the above link for geocoding, faster than OSM Nominatim
You can go two ways:
Load everything you get at the start, or require filtering before hand
Maybe require filtering, but before hand show upcoming events, like the
most popular ones.
-The times are really precise with start and end times, so use that for the
filtering function on the web page.
- Get and load precinct, community board and other geoJSONs and link them to the
search of events
- 
Park has GIS PropNum, ompropid, gisobjid

Park permit areas has GIS PropNum for parks, and OMPPROPID (Unique identification number for a 
property or portion of a property. In some cases – a standalone, smaller park for example – 
this number will be equivalent to the GIS Property Number. In other cases – a zone, playground 
or other site within a larger park – an additional designation of letters and/or numbers will be added.)
or just Name, or SubPropertyName or SYSTEM(i think is best, over Name) or CEMSID, PropertyName is park name

Use Athletic Fields Too. 

i think they load now.

so add filtering.
