Use the above link for geocoding, faster than OSM Nominatim
You can go two ways:
Load everything you get at the start, or require filtering before hand
Maybe require filtering, but before hand show upcoming events, like the
most popular ones.
-The times are really precise with start and end times, so use that for the
filtering function on the web page.
- Get and load precinct, community board and other geoJSONs and link them to the
search of events
